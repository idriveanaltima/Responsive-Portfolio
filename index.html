        Where to start? I am a fair weather runner because I can't run more than a half a mile on a treadmill without going crazy.
        I enjoy learning about things and have been known to take things apart and never put them back together. Once I know
        how they work I'm good.

        I redesigned my landscape last year and planted 6 gardens and then I needed a bigger space to store my new gardening tools
        so I built a shed. Honestly, writing about myself is probably the hardest part of this assignment. Like introductions
        it's always been strange to me. I'll probably rewrite this 6 times before I pass it in.
